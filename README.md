### Tech Store Inventory
This project is an MVC web application that mimics an inventory tracker for a technology store. It takes user input as product information and displays all products in the database on the Products page. Stylized with Bootstrap5.

### Newsletter
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a newsletter sign up page. It takes user input and submits the user's information to the database. An admin page was created to display all users that have signed up for the newsletter. Stylized with Bootstrap5.

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a Car Insurance website that offers quotes. User Input is received and business logic is used on the user input to calculate a quote. An all-users list can be access with all of their input information, and an admin page was created to show the quotes for each user. Stylized with Bootstrap5.

### Student Tracker
This project is a simple Code-First Console Application that keeps track of students and their grades. The database and its content are created based on the code in the application, and is connected through the Entity Framework.
